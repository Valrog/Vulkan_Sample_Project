# Vulkan Environment in Visual Studio
This is merely a quick reference guide that will help you set up a Vulkan template for Visual Studio. If you have never done this before, a more detailed and comprehensive guide can be found [here][1], and it is also the main guide which this one is based upon.

# Requirements
It is assumed that the required software is already installed on your system. It is also assumed that your hardware has Vulkan support and your drivers are up to date.

* [Visual Studio 2017][2]
* [Vulkan SDK][3]
* [GLFW utility library][4]
* [GLM mathematics library][5]

# Configuring Visual Studio

Project Templates have been changed in Visual Studio 2017 [Update 15.3][6]. For this setup, a ``Windows Desktop Wizard`` will be used as the foundation.

# Removing Templates

Removing a template from Visual Studio 2017 is done by deleting a template inside the ``ProjectTemplatesCache`` folder. Full path to this folder is located at ``%APPDATA%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\<version_ID>\ProjectTemplatesCache``
