# Vulkan Environment in Visual Studio
This is merely a quick reference guide that will help you set up a Vulkan template for Visual Studio. If you have never done this before, a more detailed and comprehensive guide can be found [here][1], and it is also the main guide which this one is based upon.

# Requirements
It is assumed that you already have [Visual Studio 2017][2] installed on your system, as well as [Vulkan SDK][3]. It is also assumed that your hardware has Vulkan support and your drivers are up to date. We will use [GLFW utility library][4] and the [GLM mathematics library][5].
