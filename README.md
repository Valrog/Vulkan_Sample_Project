# Vulkan Environment in Visual Studio
This is merely a quick reference guide that will help you set up a Vulkan template for Visual Studio. If you have never done this before, a more detailed and comprehensive guide can be found [here][1], and it is also the main guide which this one is based upon.

# Requirements
It is assumed that the required software is already installed on your system. It is also assumed that your hardware has Vulkan support and your drivers are up to date.

* [Visual Studio 2017][2]
* [Vulkan SDK][3]
* [GLFW utility library][4]
* [GLM mathematics library][5]

# Configuring Visual Studio

Project Templates have been changed in Visual Studio 2017 [Update 15.3][6]. For this setup, a ``Windows Desktop Wizard`` will be used as the foundation.

The new Project Options window now looks like this.

A new ``C++ File (.cpp)`` is added to the ``Source Files``. This will serve as the main file for the Vulkan template.

Sample file is included in this guide and can be used as a starting point.

## Writing The Source File

In the ``main.cpp`` file, we add some Vulkan, GLFW and GLM code that serve as a starting point for the template. Includedd main.cpp in this project can be used. There will be errors before Visual Studio is fully configured. Testing function ``vulkan_glm_test()`` can be removed before exporting the template, to have a clean template for future projects.

## Configuring Properties

Visual Studio must be configured to know where to find Vulkan dependencies and directories. These settings can be found under ``Project`` -> ``Properties``. ``All Configurations`` should be selected. Vulkan, GLFW and GLM header directories are included through ``C/C++`` -> ``General`` -> ``Additional Include Directories``.

Under ``Linker`` -> ``General`` -> ``Additional Library Directories``, appropriate Vulkan and GLFW library directories have to be added.

**Note:** Example shows configuring files for ``64-bit`` development. Setup for ``32-bit`` development is equivalent, the main difference is in which files are linked.

Vulkan and GFWL object files are added through ``Linker`` -> ``Input`` -> ``Additional Dependencies``.

## Testing

After compiling the project, the command prompt and a blank window appear on the screen. The number of supported extensions should be non-zero. If the program returns zero, then this means something went wrong during driver or SDK installations.

# Exporting a Template

Exporting a template is done through ``Project`` -> ``Export Template...`` -> ``Project template`` window. ``Icon Image`` and ``Preview Image`` can be found in the ``Resources`` folder of this project.

**Note:** Apparently it is normal behaviour for Visual Studio to not actually include the files when exporting C++ templates. A quick workaround is to simply drag and drop the main.cpp file into the ``Source Files``, instead of adding them through the ``New Item...`` option, before exporting the template. Doing this should solve missing file error.

It is not known why Visual Studio chooses to ignore these files, considering the ``C#`` template export works as one would expect.

# Removing Templates

Removing a template from Visual Studio 2017 is done by deleting a template inside the ``ProjectTemplates`` folder. Full path to this folder is located at ``%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Templates\ProjectTemplates``.

It is also preferable to clear the ``ProjectTemplatesCache`` folder. Full path to this folder is located at ``%APPDATA%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\<version_ID>\ProjectTemplatesCache``.

It is advised to also delete the templte from the ``My Exported Templates`` directory, which is located at ``%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio 2017\My Exported Templates``.
